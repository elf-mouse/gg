    <div>
        Here is a &lt;div&gt; having float: left and clear: left. As expected,
        it takes, it occupies as much width it requires from the body's content
        area.
    </div>

    <div>
        This is the same type of &lt;div&gt; : a left-floated &lt;div&gt; with
        clear: left. This &lt;div&gt; should use, should take, should occupy
        the whole content area of the body node (expected results). However, in
        Internet Explorer 7, this left-floated &lt;div&gt; with clear: left only
        takes, only occupies a very narrow chunk of the body's content area
        (actual results). More text filling. More text filling. More text
        filling. More text filling. More text filling.

    <div>
        Here, a third &lt;div&gt; having float: left and clear: left. Change
        your browser window viewport's width.
